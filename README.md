# pygame-prototype

Based on this *RealPython* [project](https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/pygame-a-primer), documented in this 
[article](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/), which is a primer on [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/).

I've refactored the code, main change is the addition of the ``Game`` class. 

New graphics downloaded from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org).
